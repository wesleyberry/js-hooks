First hook - useState

Problem - reusing logic, giant components, confusing classes

Hooks allow you to use state and other React features without writing a class.

useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that allows you to update it.
    unlike this.setState, it does not merge the old and new state together

useEffect adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component.
    serves the same purpose at componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount
    useEffect runs after every render and update
